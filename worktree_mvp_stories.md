# Overview

This document enumerates the minimum viable set of stories required to let **coder agents** work on multiple stories in sequence through
light-weight Git *worktrees*.  
The scope deliberately excludes containerisation, database name-spacing, and parallel test execution; those will arrive in a later milestone.

## Core Assumptions

| Setting | Value / Default |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Git repo URL** | Provided in top-level JSON config as `repo_url`; SSH push (keys pre-installed). |
| **Base branch** | `main` |
| **Mirror clone dir** | Config key `mirror_dir` -> default **`$WORKDIR/.mirrors`** (relative to WORKDIR) |
| **Worktree path** | `{$WORKDIR}/{AGENT_ID}/{STORY_ID}` |
| **Branch pattern** | `story-{STORY_ID}` where STORY_ID = story filename without .md extension |
| **Story ID** | Canonical story ID derived from filename (e.g., `050.md` -> `050`) |
| **Test command** | `make test` (repo must implement the `test` target) |
| **Parallel test runners** | 1 (serial) |
| **PR authentication** | Push via SSH. PR opened with GitHub CLI (`gh`) if `GITHUB_TOKEN` is set; otherwise skip auto-PR creation and rely on manual merge. |

# Stories

> Story IDs use the **AR-1xx** namespace (Architect Roadmap, sprint 1).

## **AR-101 — Add `SETUP` State and Transitions**

**Goal** – Make `SETUP` the entry point for workspace preparation and allow recovery from `ERROR`.

### Tasks
1. Add `SETUP` to the coder-agent FSM enum.
2. Define transitions  
   * `WAITING -> SETUP` : when story assigned via channel-based dispatcher  
   * `DONE -> SETUP` : after successful cleanup for next story (fresh start)  
   * `ERROR -> SETUP` : on retry (fresh start, no state preservation)
3. Update Mermaid diagrams and the compile-time transition validation table.
4. Use existing channel-based approach in pkg/dispatcher for state transitions (no new event emission needed).

### Acceptance Criteria
* Unit tests verify all new transitions succeed and invalid ones fail.  
* DONE and ERROR are no longer terminal.

---

## **AR-102 — Workspace Initialisation in `SETUP`**

**Goal** – Create (or reuse) a mirror clone, then add a story-specific worktree and branch.

### Tasks
1. **Mirror clone**  
   * If `<mirror_dir>/<repo>.git` is absent ->  
     `git clone --mirror {repo_url} {mirror_path}`  
   * Always run `git -C {mirror_path} fetch origin {base_branch}`.
2. **Worktree path** = `${WORKDIR}/${AGENT_ID}/${STORY_ID}`.  
   * Ensure parent dirs exist.  
   * `git -C {mirror_path} worktree add --detach {worktree_path} origin/{base_branch}`.
3. **Branch checkout**  
   * `git -C {worktree_path} switch -c story-{STORY_ID}`.
4. Export `WORKTREE_PATH` env var for subsequent steps.
5. On any error -> transition to `ERROR` with diagnostic message.

### Test Strategy
* **Unit tests**: Use `GitRunner` interface with mocked implementation for pure logic testing.
* **Functional tests**: Use `t.TempDir()` with real local Git repo (no network) to test actual Git operations.

### Acceptance Criteria
* Functional test proves a clean worktree is created in <300 ms on a warm cache.  
* Mirror used by two agents shares object dir (verify via hard-link count).

## **AR-103 — Run `make test` inside Worktree**

**Goal** – Execute project-defined tests and surface failures before PR.

### Tasks
1. In **CODING** state exit hook, run:  
   `pushd $WORKTREE_PATH && make test && popd`.
2. Capture stdout/stderr; attach summary to PR body (next story) or to the `ERROR` message.
3. If `make test` exits non-zero -> transition to `ERROR`.

### Acceptance Criteria
* Repository with a deliberately failing test leaves agent in `ERROR`.  
* Successful run produces log file `test-report.txt` inside the PR artifacts dir.

---

## **AR-104 — Push Branch & Open Pull Request**

**Goal** – Surface code for architectural review.

### Tasks
1. Push branch via SSH:  
   `git -C $WORKTREE_PATH push -u origin story-{STORY_ID}`.
2. If `GITHUB_TOKEN` present -> call  
   `gh pr create --fill --base {base_branch} --head story-{STORY_ID} --label "agent-story"`
   * Title template: **"Story #{STORY_ID}: generated by agent {AGENT_ID}"**
3. Post PR URL (or commit SHA) back to the architect agent.

### Acceptance Criteria
* Branch is visible on GitHub with expected name.  
* PR auto-created when token exists; skipped otherwise without failure.

---

## **AR-105 — Cleanup Worktree after Merge or Abort**

**Goal** – Free disk and prepare agent for next story.

### Tasks
1. In **DONE** state entry hook, call  
   `git -C {mirror_path} worktree remove {worktree_path}`  
   then `git -C {mirror_path} worktree prune`.
2. Remove agent-level temp dir if empty.  
3. Use channel-based dispatcher to transition back to `SETUP` for next story.

### Acceptance Criteria
* `du -sh {worktree_path}` fails after cleanup (path gone).  
* Mirror no longer lists the worktree (`git worktree list`).

---

## **AR-106 — JSON Config Loader**

**Goal** – Centralise repo & path settings.

### Tasks
1. Add Git settings to top-level Config struct: `RepoURL`, `BaseBranch`, `MirrorDir`, `WorktreePattern`, `BranchPattern`
2. Add CLI flag `--config /path/to/config.json`.
3. Validate & hydrate defaults when keys missing.

### Acceptance Criteria
* Missing mandatory field causes orchestrator start-up error.  
* `go vet ./...` and `go test ./...` stay green.

---

## **AR-107 — FSM & Workspace Unit-Test Suite**

**Goal** – Guard against regressions.

### Tasks
1. Table-driven tests for all new transitions.  
2. **Unit tests**: Use `GitRunner` interface with mocked implementation for pure logic testing.
3. **Functional tests**: Use `t.TempDir()` with real local Git repo (no network) to test actual Git operations.

### Acceptance Criteria
* `go test ./...` passes in <2 s on CI.

---

## **AR-108 — Documentation & Example**

**Goal** – Help contributors spin up the system.

### Tasks
1. Update `README.md` with diagram, config file example, and quick-start commands.  
2. Add Mermaid diagram of revised FSM.

### Acceptance Criteria
* New developer can follow README to process a dummy story end-to-end.
