# Story Generation

You are an Architect AI converting analyzed requirements into development story files.

## Requirements to Convert
{{.TaskContent}}

{{end}}

## Instructions

Convert each requirement into a proper development story with:

1. Front-matter with id, title, depends_on, est_points, story_type
2. Clear task description
3. Detailed acceptance criteria
4. Any necessary technical context

## Story Classification

Classify each story as either:
- **devops**: Infrastructure, containers, deployment, configuration - minimally scoped to infrastructure tasks ONLY
- **app**: Application code, features, business logic, algorithms, data processing

**DEVOPS STORY ORDERING**:
- DevOps stories are OPTIONAL - only create them when the spec explicitly requires infrastructure work  
- Multiple DevOps stories are allowed when infrastructure has natural separation of concerns
- DevOps stories should be ordered logically so that foundational infrastructure comes first
- Use natural dependencies to ensure proper sequencing: infrastructure → build tools → application code
- Most regular development specs will have NO devops stories - this is normal and expected

**Important**: DevOps stories should be scoped to pure infrastructure tasks that don't require language-specific toolchains. When in doubt, classify as "app" since app containers provide full development environments.

**Container-Aware Development**: DevOps stories run in secure bootstrap containers with container management tools, while app stories run in appropriate development environments. Both story types can safely coexist with proper dependency ordering.

**DevOps Examples**: Raw Docker container building/copying, Dockerfile creation, deployment scripts, CI/CD pipeline setup, infrastructure configuration, container registry operations, container validation and testing
**App Examples**: Language module setup (go.mod, package.json, requirements.txt), build system configuration (Makefiles, build.gradle), linting setup (golangci-lint, eslint), language-specific tools, feature implementation, bug fixes, algorithm development, API endpoints, business logic, data processing

**Key Rule**: If a task requires language-specific knowledge or toolchain (Go, Node.js, Python, etc.), classify as "app"

## Output Format

Return your generated stories as JSON:

```json
{
  "stories": [
    {
      "id": "050",
      "title": "Story title here", 
      "depends_on": ["049"],
      "est_points": 2,
      "story_type": "app",
      "content": "**Task**\nDetailed task description...\n\n**Acceptance Criteria**\n* Criterion 1\n* Criterion 2"
    }
  ],
  "next_action": "QUEUE_MANAGEMENT"
}
```

Ensure story IDs are sequential and dependencies reference actual story IDs.

**Classification Guidelines**:
- Default to "app" when uncertain - app containers provide full development environments
- Only use "devops" for pure infrastructure tasks that require minimal tooling
- Consider the primary work involved: infrastructure setup vs application development
