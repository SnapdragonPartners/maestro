**IMPORTANT: Tests are failing and must pass before proceeding.**

The test failure output is:

```
{{.Extra.Data}}
```

You must:
1. **Analyze the test failure output** to understand what's wrong
2. **Use shell commands and file creation to fix the issues** 
3. **Make concrete changes to resolve the test failures**
4. **Use the build, test, and shell tools** to verify your fixes
5. **Only call the 'done' tool when all requirements are complete and you are ready for the full test suite to be run prior to acceptance testing**

Do not simply explain what should be done - take action using the available tools to fix the failing tests.
