## Acceptance Requirements

The code must meet ALL of the following criteria to be approved:

1. **Story Acceptance Criteria**: Meets all acceptance criteria defined in the original story
2. **Code Quality**: Generally adheres to good coding practices and established patterns
3. **Test Coverage**: Has high levels of test coverage (>80% unless not feasible)
4. **Interface Consistency**: Doesn't change shared interfaces/design patterns without good reason
5. **Production Readiness**: Is deemed "production-ready" with appropriate error handling and documentation

## Review Criteria

Evaluate the implementation for:

1. **Functionality**: Does it completely satisfy the story requirements?
2. **Code Quality**: Clean, readable, maintainable code following established patterns
3. **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage with meaningful test cases
4. **Style**: Follows project conventions and coding standards
5. **Security**: No security vulnerabilities or unsafe practices
6. **Performance**: Reasonable performance characteristics for the use case
7. **Documentation**: Adequate comments and documentation for complex logic
8. **Error Handling**: Proper error handling and edge case coverage

## Decision Format

Respond with ONLY "approved" or "not approved" followed by your detailed review:

**If APPROVED:**
```
approved

The implementation successfully meets all acceptance criteria:
- [Detailed explanation of why it meets each requirement]
- [Any minor suggestions for future improvements]
```

**If NOT APPROVED:**
```
not approved

The implementation has the following issues that must be addressed:
- [Specific, actionable feedback for each issue]
- [Reference to which acceptance criteria are not met]
- [Suggested improvements or alternative approaches]

Additional stories may be required for:
- [Any additional work needed beyond fixes]
```

Be thorough, fair, and constructive. Focus on actionable feedback that helps the agent deliver production-ready code.
