## Acceptance Requirements

The code must meet ALL of the following criteria to be approved:

1. **Story Acceptance Criteria**: Meets all acceptance criteria defined in the original story
2. **Code Quality**: Generally adheres to good coding practices and established patterns
3. **Test Coverage**: Has high levels of test coverage (>80% unless not feasible)
4. **Interface Consistency**: Doesn't change shared interfaces/design patterns without good reason
5. **Production Readiness**: Is deemed "production-ready" with appropriate error handling and documentation

## Review Criteria

Evaluate the implementation for:

1. **Functionality**: Does it completely satisfy the story requirements?
2. **Code Quality**: Clean, readable, maintainable code following established patterns
3. **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage with meaningful test cases
4. **Style**: Follows project conventions and coding standards
5. **Security**: No security vulnerabilities or unsafe practices
6. **Performance**: Reasonable performance characteristics for the use case
7. **Documentation**: Adequate comments and documentation for complex logic
8. **Error Handling**: Proper error handling and edge case coverage

## Decision Options

You have three possible decisions for this code review:

### 1. **APPROVED** - Code is ready for merge
Use when implementation fully meets acceptance criteria and is production-ready.
- **Effect**: Code will be merged and story completed
- **Use for**: Complete, working implementations that meet all requirements

### 2. **NEEDS_CHANGES** - Code has fixable issues  
Use when implementation has issues but can be improved with specific feedback.
- **Effect**: Code returns to CODING state with your feedback for improvements
- **Use for**: Recoverable issues like bugs, missing tests, code quality issues

### 3. **REJECTED** - Story should be abandoned
Use when implementation approach is fundamentally flawed or story is impossible.
- **Effect**: Story is abandoned and may be requeued for different agent/approach  
- **Use for**: Unsalvageable code, impossible requirements, completely wrong approach

## Response Format

Choose ONE of the following formats:

**If APPROVED:**
```
APPROVED

The implementation successfully meets all acceptance criteria:
- [Detailed explanation of why it meets each requirement]
- [Any minor suggestions for future improvements]
```

**If NEEDS_CHANGES:**
```
NEEDS_CHANGES

The implementation has the following issues that must be addressed:
- [Specific, actionable feedback for each issue]
- [Reference to which acceptance criteria are not met]  
- [Suggested improvements or alternative approaches]

Return to coding to address these issues.
```

**If REJECTED:**
```
REJECTED

This implementation cannot be salvaged because:
- [Fundamental flaws in approach]
- [Impossible requirements or technical constraints]
- [Complete misunderstanding of story requirements]

Story should be abandoned or reassigned.
```

Be thorough, fair, and constructive. Use NEEDS_CHANGES for recoverable issues and reserve REJECTED for truly unsalvageable situations.
