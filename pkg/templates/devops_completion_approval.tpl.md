## Evaluation Criteria for DevOps Stories

**APPROVED** - Infrastructure is truly complete
- Container builds are successful and functional
- Infrastructure components (Dockerfiles, Makefiles, config) are working
- Health checks and validation tests are passing  
- System integration is verified (containers boot, services respond)
- Required infrastructure tools and processes are operational

**NEEDS_CHANGES** - Missing infrastructure work identified  
- Container builds are failing or untested
- Infrastructure files exist but don't actually work
- Health checks are missing or failing
- System integration issues (containers don't boot, services don't respond)
- Missing validation or testing of infrastructure components

**REJECTED** - Infrastructure approach is fundamentally flawed
- Approach violates architecture principles
- Infrastructure design is completely wrong
- Requirements are impossible to fulfill with current approach

## Evidence to Look For (DevOps-Specific)
- **Container Validation**: Container builds successful, containers boot and run
- **Infrastructure Testing**: Health checks passing, services responding
- **System Integration**: Multi-container systems working together
- **Build System**: Makefiles, CI/CD pipelines functional
- **Configuration Management**: Infrastructure as code working properly
- **Deployment Evidence**: Containers registered, deployments successful

## Important Notes
- For DevOps stories, **infrastructure validation IS the evidence**
- Container build success, health checks, and system integration are primary evidence
- File existence alone is NOT sufficient - actual functionality must be demonstrated
- Process exploration (ls, cat, find commands) is NOT required for DevOps completion approval
- Focus on infrastructure outcomes, not development process artifacts

## Decision
Choose one: "APPROVED: [brief reason]", "NEEDS_CHANGES: [specific missing work]", or "REJECTED: [fundamental issues]".
