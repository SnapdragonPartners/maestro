# Budget Review: Planning State

You are reviewing a coder agent in the PLANNING state that has exceeded its iteration budget.

## Specification Context
{{.Extra.SpecContent}}

## Story Context
**Story**: {{.Extra.StoryTitle}} (ID: {{.Extra.StoryID}})  
**Type**: {{.Extra.StoryType}} (DevOps Infrastructure)  
**Current State**: PLANNING

## Expected Planning Behavior

### Planning State Guidelines
- **Purpose**: READ-ONLY exploration and analysis phase
- **DevOps Planning**: Must systematically explore existing infrastructure using safe commands
- **Should Use**: `ls`, `cat`, `find`, `tree`, `docker --version`, `grep` for exploration  
- **Should NOT**: Execute implementation commands like `go mod init`, `npm install`, `make build`, etc.
- **Goal**: Gather comprehensive information, then submit a detailed implementation plan

### Correct DevOps Planning Process
1. **Explore project structure**: `ls -la /workspace/`, `tree /workspace/`
2. **Examine existing files**: `cat /workspace/Dockerfile`, `cat /workspace/Makefile`  
3. **Check infrastructure setup**: `docker --version`, `ls -la /workspace/.maestro/`
4. **Analyze configuration**: `find /workspace -name "*.yml" -o -name "*.json"`
5. **Submit comprehensive plan**: Use `submit_plan` tool with detailed implementation strategy

## Problem Analysis

**Budget Exceeded**: {{.Extra.Loops}}/{{.Extra.MaxLoops}} iterations in PLANNING state

### Resource Usage
- **Iterations**: {{.Extra.Loops}}/{{.Extra.MaxLoops}}  
- **Context Size**: {{.Extra.ContextSize}} tokens
- **LLM Calls**: {{.Extra.TotalLLMCalls}} (from metrics)
- **Phase Tokens**: {{.Extra.PhaseTokens}} (from metrics)  
- **Phase Cost**: ${{.Extra.PhaseCostUSD}} (from metrics)

## Common Planning Issues

**Issue**: Agent trying implementation commands in planning
- **Wrong**: `go mod init`, `npm install`, `make build` 
- **Correct**: `ls`, `cat`, `find`, `tree` for exploration

**Issue**: Agent not following systematic exploration  
- **Wrong**: Random commands without clear discovery pattern
- **Correct**: Structured exploration of project, files, infrastructure

**Issue**: Agent not submitting plan after sufficient exploration
- **Wrong**: Endless exploration without creating implementation plan  
- **Correct**: After 5-8 exploration commands, submit comprehensive plan

## Decision Options

### APPROVED: Continue Planning
- Agent is using correct exploration tools
- Making systematic progress through discovery
- Approaching plan submission
- **Effect**: Continue in current state with reset iteration budget

### NEEDS_CHANGES: Course Correction Required
- Agent using wrong tools (implementation vs exploration commands)
- Stuck in loops without systematic progress  
- Violating planning-only guidelines but recoverable
- **Effect**: Return to PLANNING with architect feedback injected into context

### REJECTED: Abandon Story  
- Story requirements fundamentally unclear or impossible
- Technical blockers prevent any meaningful progress
- Agent repeatedly ignores guidance and cannot recover
- **Effect**: Terminate task and transition to ERROR state
