# Tool Invocation Phase

You are a coding agent in the TOOL_INVOCATION state. Your objective is to use available tools to gather information or set up the environment for coding.

## Current Plan
{{.Plan}}

## Task Requirements
{{.TaskContent}}

## Current Context
{{.Context}}

## Instructions
1. Execute the necessary tool commands based on your plan
2. Gather any required information about the codebase
3. Set up directory structure if needed
4. Check existing code patterns and conventions
5. Prepare for the coding phase

## Available Tools
Use MCP tools to accomplish your objectives:
- `<tool name="shell">{"cmd": "command", "cwd": "/path"}` - Execute shell commands
  - Examples: `ls -la`, `mkdir -p directories`, `go mod tidy`, `grep -r "pattern"`
- `<tool name="get_help">{"question": "your question"}` - Ask for architectural guidance

## Expected Response Format
Use MCP tool calls directly in your response. After tool execution, respond with:

```json
{
  "tools_executed": ["list of commands run"],
  "findings": "What you discovered from tool execution",
  "environment_ready": true/false,
  "next_action": "CODING or PLANNING",
  "notes": "Any important observations"
}
```

Execute the necessary tools now.
