- Required files have been created/modified appropriately
- Feature works as intended based on evidence provided

**NEEDS_CHANGES** - Missing work identified  
- Core functionality is incomplete or partially working
- Tests are failing or missing when required
- Code quality issues that need to be addressed
- Missing files or incomplete implementation
- Requirements not fully satisfied

**REJECTED** - Story approach is fundamentally flawed
- Implementation approach is completely wrong
- Requirements are impossible to fulfill
- Story should be abandoned or redesigned

## Evidence to Look For

- **File Changes**: Source files created, modified, or configured
- **Test Results**: Unit tests, integration tests passing
- **Feature Validation**: Evidence the feature works as intended
- **Build Success**: Code compiles and builds successfully
