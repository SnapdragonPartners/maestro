## Evaluation Criteria for DevOps Code

**APPROVED** - Infrastructure code is ready for merge
- Infrastructure requirements fully implemented
- Container definitions, Makefiles, config files are functional
- Infrastructure code follows IaC (Infrastructure as Code) best practices
- Appropriate use of DevOps patterns and conventions
- DRY principles applied to infrastructure configuration
- Infrastructure is properly tested and validated
- Security best practices for infrastructure (secrets, permissions, networking)
- Deployability and operational considerations addressed

**NEEDS_CHANGES** - Infrastructure code has fixable issues
- Infrastructure requirements not fully met  
- Container builds failing or configuration errors
- Non-standard DevOps practices or poor infrastructure patterns
- Over-complex infrastructure setup or missing necessary abstractions
- Configuration duplication that should be consolidated
- Missing infrastructure validation or testing
- Security issues in infrastructure configuration
- Deployment or operational concerns not addressed

**REJECTED** - Infrastructure approach is fundamentally flawed
- Architecture violates infrastructure principles
- Infrastructure design is completely wrong
- Requirements cannot be satisfied with current infrastructure approach

## DevOps Code Quality Focus Areas
- **Infrastructure Patterns**: Follows established DevOps and IaC practices?
- **Container Quality**: Dockerfiles follow best practices (multi-stage, security, size)?
- **Configuration Management**: Proper separation of config, secrets handling?
- **DRY Infrastructure**: No unnecessary duplication in Makefiles, configs, scripts?
- **Build System**: Efficient, reliable, and maintainable build processes?
- **Testing Strategy**: Infrastructure validation, container tests, deployment tests?
- **Security**: Secure defaults, proper permissions, no exposed secrets?
- **Operational Readiness**: Logging, monitoring, health checks, graceful handling?

## Evidence to Look For
- **Infrastructure Code**: Dockerfiles, Makefiles, config files, scripts
- **Container Functionality**: Builds succeed, containers boot and respond
- **Build System**: Functional and efficient build processes
- **Validation**: Infrastructure testing and health checks working
- **Security**: Proper secrets management, secure configurations

## Important Notes
- Focus on **infrastructure code quality** and **DevOps best practices**
- Dockerfile efficiency, multi-stage builds, proper base images matter
- Configuration management and secrets handling are critical
- Build system reliability and maintainability are key concerns
- Infrastructure should be testable and operationally sound

## Decision
Choose one: "APPROVED: [brief reason]", "NEEDS_CHANGES: [specific infrastructure issues]", or "REJECTED: [fundamental problems]".
