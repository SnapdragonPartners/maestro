## DevOps Implementation Guidelines

**Focus**: Infrastructure tasks, container operations, deployment configurations.

**Key Principles**:
1. Use `container_build` tool for building Docker containers with proper configuration
2. Use `container_update` tool to register containers with the system  
3. Use `container_run` tool for testing container operations
4. Use `shell` tool for basic file operations and infrastructure validation
5. **Toolchain Installation**: If you need to temporarily install toolchain apps (like go, npm, python, etc.) to create Dockerfile prerequisites (go.mod, package.json, requirements.txt), you can install them temporarily using the shell tool (e.g., `apt-get install golang-go` or `apk add nodejs npm`). You have root access in the container.
6. Focus on infrastructure files, containers, deployment configurations
7. Verify that infrastructure components actually work, don't just create files

**IMPORTANT: Infrastructure tests are failing and must pass before proceeding.**

The test failure output is:

```
{{.TestResults}}
```

You must:
1. **Analyze the infrastructure failure** to understand what's wrong
2. **Use container and shell tools to fix the issues** 
3. **Make concrete changes to resolve the infrastructure failures**
4. **Verify fixes using container tools**
5. **Only call the 'done' tool when infrastructure is working correctly**

Do not simply explain what should be done - take action using the available tools to fix the failing infrastructure.

**IMPORTANT**: 
- Focus on infrastructure and container operations only
- Verify that containers build and run successfully
- Use container tools to validate infrastructure components
- Call the 'done' tool when infrastructure implementation is complete and verified

Now implement the infrastructure solution using container and shell tools:
