## Review Request

**Please confirm this completion determination:**

1. ✅ **Completion is valid** - Requirements were already met, no changes needed
   - If yes: **APPROVE** to mark the story complete

2. ⚠️ **Additional work needed** - I missed something that should be implemented
   - If yes: Use **NEEDS_CHANGES** with specific guidance on what work is required

3. ❌ **Wrong assessment** - Story clearly needs implementation
   - If yes: Use **REJECTED** and I will return to planning/coding
