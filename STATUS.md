# PROJECT STATUS - Phase 6 Agent Foundation Improvements

**Date:** 2025-06-12  
**Session:** PHASE6.md Foundational Agent Package Work  
**Primary Goal:** Make /pkg/agent production-ready with robust state management, LLM abstraction, and driver architecture

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED WORK

### 1. State Machine Architecture ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- **BaseStateMachine implementation** with concurrency protection via mutex
- **State persistence and restoration** with JSON serialization to StateStore
- **State transition validation** with ValidTransitions map enforcing allowed flows
- **Retry logic with exponential backoff** - retry counting and max retry enforcement
- **State compaction** - automatic cleanup of old transitions (max 100 retained)
- **Context cancellation support** throughout all state operations
- **Comprehensive error handling** with proper error types (ErrStateNotFound, ErrInvalidTransition, etc.)

### 2. LLM Client Abstraction ‚úÖ COMPLETE  
- **Unified LLMClient interface** supporting both Claude and O3 models
- **Claude integration** with official Anthropic SDK v1.4.0
- **O3 integration** with OpenAI client
- **Mock client implementation** for testing with configurable responses
- **Mode system** (MOCK, DEBUG, LIVE) for different environments
- **Proper configuration validation** with model-specific token limits (Claude 3.5 Sonnet: 8192 max)

### 3. Driver Architecture ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- **BaseDriver implementation** with lifecycle methods (Initialize, Run, Step, Shutdown)
- **State machine integration** - drivers use StateMachine interface internally
- **Error handling and recovery** - automatic transition to ERROR state on failures
- **Context cancellation support** - graceful handling of cancelled operations
- **State persistence** - automatic state saving on transitions

### 4. Timeout Support ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- **TimeoutConfig struct** with configurable timeouts for different operations:
  - StateTimeout: 2 minutes per state processing
  - GlobalTimeout: 30 minutes total runtime
  - ShutdownTimeout: 10 seconds for graceful shutdown
- **StepWithTimeout()** method for individual state processing with timeout
- **RunWithTimeout()** method for main driver loop with global timeout
- **Context-based timeout handling** with proper error reporting

### 5. Configuration System ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- **AgentConfig struct** with comprehensive validation
- **LLMConfig with token limits** enforced at validation time
- **AgentContext** providing logger, work directory, and state storage
- **Configuration validation** preventing invalid token limits and missing required fields

### 6. Error Types and Validation ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- **Comprehensive error definitions**:
  - ErrStateNotFound - for missing state data
  - ErrInvalidTransition - for illegal state changes
  - ErrMaxRetriesExceeded - for retry limit enforcement
- **State transition validation** with ValidTransitions enforcement
- **Safe state restoration** with nil checks and graceful error handling

### 7. Testing Infrastructure ‚úÖ IN PROGRESS
- **Test helpers** for setting up test drivers and contexts
- **Mock state store** integration for isolated testing
- **BaseDriver tests** covering state transitions, persistence, and error handling
- **Context cancellation tests** verifying proper cleanup
- **State compaction tests** ensuring data management works correctly

## üéØ CURRENT STATUS

### Agent Package Foundation ‚úÖ MOSTLY COMPLETE

**IMPLEMENTATION STATUS:**
1. ‚úÖ **State Machine** - Robust implementation with persistence, validation, retry logic
2. ‚úÖ **LLM Abstraction** - Unified interface with Claude/O3 clients and mock support  
3. ‚úÖ **Driver Architecture** - Complete lifecycle management with error handling
4. ‚úÖ **Timeout Support** - Configurable timeouts preventing hanging operations
5. ‚úÖ **Configuration System** - Comprehensive validation and error handling
6. üîÑ **Testing Coverage** - Test infrastructure in place, 2 pending test implementations

### Recent Critical Fixes Applied
Based on architect feedback, implemented several critical improvements:
- **Fixed state loading** to handle missing state gracefully without panics
- **Added proper error types** for different failure scenarios
- **Implemented state transition validation** preventing invalid state changes
- **Added configuration validation** with model-specific token limits
- **Fixed Claude 3.5 Sonnet token limits** from 100k to 8192 (correct limit)
- **Added timeout support** to prevent hanging operations

### Mode System Implementation
- **Three-mode operation**: MOCK (testing), DEBUG (development), LIVE (production)
- **Global SystemMode variable** with InitMode() for configuration
- **Mock client fallback** when SystemMode == ModeMock
- **Thread-safe mode initialization** with panic protection against multiple calls

## üîÑ SESSION CONTINUITY

**ALL TASKS COMPLETED:** ‚úÖ

**COMPLETED IN THIS SESSION:**
1. ‚úÖ **Complete test implementations**:
   - Comprehensive BaseStateMachine tests with mock clients
   - Driver lifecycle tests with mock clients and error handling
   - All tests passing

2. ‚úÖ **All architect feedback improvements implemented**:
   - Retry logic for LLM clients with exponential backoff and configurable timeouts
   - Circuit breaker pattern for LLM clients with state tracking and auto-recovery  
   - Helper functions for testing with TestHelper utilities and MockFailingClient
   - Graceful shutdown handling with ShutdownManager and ShutdownableDriver

3. ‚úÖ **Model update**: Updated default Anthropic model to claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219

**TECHNICAL CONTEXT:**
- **Foundation work is 100% complete** - state machine, LLM abstraction, driver architecture, retry logic, circuit breaker, timeout handling, and graceful shutdown all production-ready
- **All critical architectural issues resolved** - comprehensive error handling, state validation, timeout support, resilient LLM clients
- **Mode system fully implemented** - supports testing, development, and production environments with proper client selection
- **Complete test coverage** - all components thoroughly tested with mock integration

**CURRENT COMPILATION STATUS:** 
- ‚úÖ **Agent package compiles and tests pass** - All foundational code is working correctly
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Other packages need updates** - pkg/coder and pkg/architect still use old LLMClient interface (GenerateResponse vs Complete method)
- üîÑ **Next session**: Update coder and architect packages to use new agent foundation

**IMPLEMENTATION HIGHLIGHTS:**
- **ResilientClient**: Combines retry logic and circuit breaker patterns for robust LLM interactions
- **ShutdownableDriver**: Provides graceful shutdown with state persistence and resumption capabilities  
- **TestHelper**: Comprehensive testing utilities for consistent test setup and assertions
- **TimeoutConfig**: Configurable timeouts preventing hanging operations in production

**USER CONTEXT:** PHASE6.md foundational agent work is now complete. The agent package is production-ready with robust error handling, resilience patterns, and comprehensive testing. Ready to proceed with updating other agent implementations to use this foundation.
