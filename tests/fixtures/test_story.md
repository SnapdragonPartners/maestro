# Test Story - User Authentication System

## Description
Implement a basic user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

## Requirements
- User registration with email and password
- User login with session management
- Password hashing for security
- Basic input validation
- JSON API endpoints

## Acceptance Criteria
- POST /register endpoint accepts email and password
- POST /login endpoint returns session token
- Passwords are hashed before storage
- Invalid inputs return proper error messages
- Session tokens expire after 24 hours

## Estimation
This should take approximately 2-3 hours to implement and test.
