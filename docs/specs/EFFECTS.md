# Effects Pattern Full Rewrite Implementation Plan

*Status: COMPLETED* ✅  
*Started: 2025-08-07*  
*Completed: 2025-08-07*

## Overview

Complete migration from inconsistent async patterns to unified Effects-based communication across all agents.

## Current Problems

1. **Broken question handling** - infinite loops with flag-based approach
2. **Inconsistent async patterns** - different approaches for questions vs approvals  
3. **Message type confusion** - QUESTION/ANSWER vs REQUEST/RESULT mixing
4. **Duplicate requests** - plan approval sending multiple messages
5. **Large monolithic files** - driver.go files too big to manage

## Target Architecture

**Simplified State Machine:**
- Remove FIXING state (deliberately eliminated) 
- Remove QUESTION state (replaced by inline Effects)
- Questions handled via Effects pattern within existing states
- State transitions match canonical STATES.md exactly

**Unified REQUEST/RESPONSE Protocol:**
```json
// Question Request
{
  "type": "REQUEST",
  "kind": "QUESTION", 
  "payload": {"text": "Should I use existing pattern?"}
}

// Question Response  
{
  "type": "RESPONSE",
  "kind": "QUESTION",
  "answer_text": "Yes, follow existing pattern"
}

// Approval Request
{
  "type": "REQUEST", 
  "kind": "APPROVAL",
  "payload": {"plan": "...", "confidence": "high"}
}

// Approval Response
{
  "type": "RESPONSE",
  "kind": "APPROVAL", 
  "decision": "APPROVE",
  "comment": "Plan looks good"
}
```

**Single Effects Pattern:**
- All async operations use `AwaitEffect` with different kinds
- Unified timeout, retry, and error handling
- Consistent logging and debugging across all async ops

## State Handler File Structure

### pkg/coder/
- `driver.go` - Main state machine coordination
- `waiting.go` - WAITING state handler
- `setup.go` - SETUP state handler  
- `planning.go` - PLANNING state handler ✓ (exists)
- `plan_review.go` - PLAN_REVIEW state handler ✓ (exists)
- `coding.go` - CODING state handler ✓ (exists)
- `testing.go` - TESTING state handler
- `code_review.go` - CODE_REVIEW state handler
- `budget_review.go` - BUDGET_REVIEW state handler
- `await_merge.go` - AWAIT_MERGE state handler

### pkg/architect/
- `driver.go` - Main state machine coordination
- `waiting.go` - WAITING state handler
- `scoping.go` - SCOPING state handler
- `dispatching.go` - DISPATCHING state handler
- `monitoring.go` - MONITORING state handler  
- `request.go` - REQUEST state handler (unified questions/approvals)

## Message Kind Types

```go
type RequestKind string
const (
    RequestKindQuestion     RequestKind = "QUESTION"
    RequestKindApproval     RequestKind = "APPROVAL"
    RequestKindExecution    RequestKind = "EXECUTION"
)

type ResponseKind string  
const (
    ResponseKindQuestion    ResponseKind = "QUESTION"
    ResponseKindApproval    ResponseKind = "APPROVAL"
    ResponseKindExecution   ResponseKind = "EXECUTION"
)
```

## Benefits

1. **Unified async model** - Single pattern for all agent communication
2. **Better state management** - No flag-based approaches
3. **Cleaner architecture** - Consistent async operations
4. **Maintainable code** - Separate files for each state handler
5. **Simpler dispatcher** - Single message processing path
6. **Better debugging** - Consistent logging across all async ops

## Risks & Mitigations

**Risk:** Breaking existing functionality during transition
**Mitigation:** Implement backward compatibility layer, thorough testing

**Risk:** Complex migration across multiple packages  
**Mitigation:** Phased approach with validation at each step

**Risk:** Performance impact of unified dispatcher
**Mitigation:** Performance testing and optimization if needed

- [x] No duplicate or inconsistent message flows ✅ **COMPLETED**
- [x] State handlers in separate, manageable files ✅ **COMPLETED**
- [x] Clean, consistent debugging and logging ✅ **COMPLETED**
- [x] Build passes cleanly with linting ✅ **COMPLETED**

## Timeline ✅ **AHEAD OF SCHEDULE**

- Eliminated all deprecated protocol elements per user directive

### Quality Assurance
- **Clean linting** with zero warnings/errors
